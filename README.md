# Legacy 2D-Party-Game

This is an archived repository for one of my extremely old Unity prototypes (that used be stored on Unity's old VCS system). 

The project in Unity Cloud states that it was created June 24, 2021 (which seems to line up with what I can remember), and Unity Hub states that it was made using Unity 2021.1.13f1 (its an old project).

This was a simple 2D physics-based platforming local-multiplayer shooter game meant for a party setting. With 4 different weapons that had unique behaviors, and semi-custom physics that worked around Unity's Rigidbody2D, this was the first 
actually serious project I had worked on (with Unity, but I may even go as far as to say in general). Being a summer project that I worked on early in my programming days, I have some fond memories of this project.

This project means a lot to me as it was really the first serious game project I had done. Sure, I had attempted to make a Mario Maker-eque game using Unity, but it never really got anywhere as I did not have the technical expertise to pull it off at the time.
It started some time early Summer in 2021, primarily as a way to test out Unity's new Input System (at the time) and its local multiplayer capabilities. I don't quite remember where the concept for this came from, but this was just a simple FFA battle game
I had designed in maybe around 2-3 months. I was nowhere near as good at programming as I am today, but I worked with the tools I had and successfully managed to make something that I am still proud of to this day. Is the code any good? Probably not (I haven't
looked too deep into it, but the glances I took weren't the most promising). Is this a sphagetti (and kind-of rushed) mess? Definitely, I remember specifically speeding up development just to get a prototype out to play at a good friend of mines birthday party.
Honestly, I'm glad that I did it because it let me get some playtesting in with friends at the party (and overall, the game was a blast and definitely a success). Corners had to be cut, and I remember working days before implementing all of the UI and 
sound effect stuff, but I'm honestly glad that I was able to get something finished in the first place.

Around halfway through development of this project, I decided that the this version of the project would be an initial prototype to gauge how fun of a game it could be (I mean, it was a local multiplayer game so it thrived in the meetup setting).
I was also still learning both C# and Unity at the time (I think I had recently moved away from Unreal's Blueprint system, or some form of Lua on Roblox, I honestly cant remember). 

I was 16 at the time, working on what I thought was going to be a stepping stone project for a more serious game, but things hadn't quite gone the way I expected. Rather than dedicate all of my time to a specific project, I hopped around projects
as I grew interested in different topics. "What was this OpenGL thing?" (is what I had wondered) and decided to learn Java and OpenGL (using LWJGL), "is MonoGame better for me than Unity because it gave me the control I wanted?". In the end, I experimented
with many different frameworks (and even programming languages, in this time I had gotten familiar with C# (Mono using C# 7/8), DotNET Core C# (using C# 10-12), Java (using jdk 11), and even C++ (using C++17 - C++20/23)) and eventually moved away from Unity.
Part of it was because I always wanted more control, and with what Unity did recently it hasn't helped. Godot, Unity, and Unreal are all tools that I have used, but I never quite felt satisfied with them. Unity being stuck in the past because
of the shift in C#'s development around C# 9, I was not a fan with Unreal's 3D with 2D tacked on style of 2D game development (I really didn't like that part), and Godot's different way of managing thing, I haven't quite settled on the tools I want to use to
make my hobby projects. Godot is the most promising one, but I just grew into the mindset of developing it all myself rather than stick to a game engine (after all, I get more control).

Honestly, this is a project that really helped push me forward fully into the world of programming. Sure, I had made other projects, but this really got me interested in what I was capable of creating. This was a simple project, but it was something that was
fun to work on at the time. I remember having a blast with this, and I'm glad that this project hasn't been lost to time. To whoever may be reading this (whether it be an employer or some random person browsing my repositories), im glad that you took the time
to read about a project I had fun making in the past.
